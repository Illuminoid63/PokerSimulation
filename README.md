# Poker Simulation
This program calculates the odds of every poker hand occurring by simulating thousands of hands of five poker cards concurrently  and then counting how many times each hand occurred. 

For example, it calculates the odds of a flush occuring.


P.S. I know there are much more elegant mathematical formulae to calculate these odds that are also far less computationally heavy than this brute force calculation, but this project is mostly me messing around with concurrency in Go and looking at computing times with and without concurrent processing.
